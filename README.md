# Python API Challenge
## Overview
This project aims to answer the fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" 

By utilizing Python, APIs, and JSON, we analyze weather data from over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.

## Part 1: WeatherPy
In this section, we create a Python script to visualize weather data. The process involves:

Generating random geographic coordinates and determining the nearest city using the citipy Python library.

Retrieving weather data for each city from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Creating scatter plots to display relationships such as:

#### Latitude vs. Temperature

#### Latitude vs. Humidity

#### Latitude vs. Cloudiness

#### Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Separating the plots into Northern and Southern hemispheres and calculating linear regression for each to analyze weather changes based on proximity to the equator.

## Part 2: VacationPy
In this section, we demonstrate how weather data can be utilized to plan future vacations. The steps include:


Creating a map displaying cities with points sized based on humidity levels.

Filtering cities based on desired weather conditions (e.g., temperature range, wind speed, cloudiness) to create a manageable DataFrame.

Creating a new DataFrame to store city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

Using the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels for each city within 10,000 meters and adding this information to the map.


### User Guide

Store API keys for Geoapify and OpenWeather App.

Run WeatherPy.ipynb to collect weather data from approximately 550-650 cities worldwide.

Graphs generated by WeatherPy.ipynb will be saved in output_data.

Run VacationPy.ipynb after WeatherPy.ipynb to plan future vacations based on the collected data.
